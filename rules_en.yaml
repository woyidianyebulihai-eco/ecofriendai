# Optional external rules file (the app already has DEFAULT_RULES embedded).
climate_zones:
  hot_humid:
    roof:
      - when: "roof_color == 'dark'"
        recommend: ["High-reflectivity roof coating (SR > 0.8)", "Cool roof membrane / ceramic heat-reflective spray"]
        saving_pct: "8-15%"
        rationale: "High solar radiation + dark roof → more heat absorption; cool the roof first."
    walls:
      - when: "humidity == 'high'"
        recommend: ["Mineral wool / wood-fiber insulation (vapor-open)", "Mold-resistant liner / breathable paint"]
        saving_pct: "3-8%"
        rationale: "Hot-humid → choose vapor-open systems to reduce moisture/mold risk."

  temperate:
    windows:
      - when: "window_area_ratio > 0.25 and orientation in ['south','west']"
        recommend: ["Low-E window film or double glazing", "External shading (louvers/overhangs/awnings)"]
        saving_pct: "4-10%"
        rationale: "Significant sun exposure in temperate zones → first reduce solar gains."

  cold_dry:
    windows:
      - when: "window_area_ratio > 0.2 and orientation in ['north','east']"
        recommend: ["Triple glazing (triple-silver Low-E)", "High-airtightness frames", "Improve perimeter sealing"]
        saving_pct: "5-12%"
        rationale: "Cold-dry → heat loss through windows dominates; prioritize insulation/airtightness."

budget:
  low: { cap: 1500, prefer: ["Weatherstrips", "Interior shades/curtains", "Localized recycled insulation"] }
  mid:  { cap: 6000, prefer: ["Cool roof coating", "Low-E window film", "External shading kits"] }
  high: { cap: 20000, prefer: ["BIPV roof", "Continuous exterior insulation", "High-performance windows/doors"] }
